# ImageProcessor

## EdgeProcessor

The program was written in June 2014 and cleaned up a bit in 2019. It was a small private side project to try out some image processing techniques. Therefore the code is rather slow and memory consuming.

The algorithm was used by my brother and my in August 2016 in an art project.

### Run
Put a picture in the pix folder (e.g. Test.jpg). Run ``App.class Test.jpg``.
The generated pictures will be placed in the pix folder.
Use small image sizes only due to memory consumption.
